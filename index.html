            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>The second Caliph of Islam, has many monikers. He is called Al-Farouq: one who differentiates right from wrong clearly. As with all people, loved and respected in Eastern cultures in particular,
                many honorifics can and are applied to him. For example, Saayiduna, which means our master, this is also applied to many of the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and also,
                many of the Prophets and Messengers sent from God, peace be upon them all. It is also common to say of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, may God be pleased with him or her or them depending on the context.
                I like to refer to him as Sayyiduna Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him. As a muslim I have many reasons for loving him.
                Additonally,  we share a name as I am also called Umar.
            </p>
            <p>
                He is well-known for his justice and, at times, harshness. But equally known for his mercy and kind-heartedness. 
                He is considered to be the first or one of the first rulers in history to implement a child benefit where people are given an allowance to support children. 
                There is also a famous story around this as initially the allowance could only be claimed for weaned children. However, one night while patrolling the city, 
                he heard a baby crying and when he learned that the reason was due to early weaning in order for the family to claim the child benefit allowance and support themselves
                he was overcome by emotion and promptly changed the rules to prevent this.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have grown up hearing stories of this great personality and believe more people other than Muslims should also know more about him.
                And would love to also. Recently, I learned of a historical tv series produced by the Middle East Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) about the life of Umar and found it both entertaining and informative.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>
                Umar grew up under a strict father: al-Khattab. They were the chiefs of the small 'Adiy clan of Quraish - the ruling tribe of Mecca at the time. He grew to be a large
                man, some reports putting him at over 7 feet tall. He was the pride of Quraysh and nominated it's Ambassador both for his impressive stature and fighting ability and
                uncommon literacy and eloquence.
            </p>
            <h3>Early years of Islam</h3>
            <p>
                In the earlier years of Islam, when the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, initially announced the message of Islam. Umar was amongst the foremost of his oponents.
                As chief of the 'Adiy clan after his father, he implemented harsh punishments (truly torture by beatings and similar) against the people of his clan who had accepted the message and become the first Muslims.
                This was the agreement made between the chiefs of Quraysh that each chief would punish his own people so as to avoid conflict between themselves.
            </p>
            <h3>Acceptance of Islam</h3>
            <p>
                After several years as the message of Islam grew amongst the people of Mecca, and more and more people abandoned the many gods of Quraysh. Umar decided that 
                enough was enough. Everything he had tried with the other chiefs of Quraysh had not slowed the growth of Islam. He decided that he must kill the Prophet, peace be upon him. 
                However, on his way he came across someone who informed him that his own sister and brother-in-law were Muslim, so he headed to them instead. In his rage, he beat them until 
                his sister bled, at which point he felt remorse and stopped. As he paused and thought, he was able to hear the message of Islam for the first time. And thus, the staunchest 
                enemy of the religion became it's staunchest believer and added his strength to the message of Islam.
            </p>
            <h3>Years as a Muslim</h3>
            <p>
                He spent the next years as a Muslim and a strong supporter of the message of the oneness of God and the commandments of the Qur'an and the Messenger, peace be upon him. 
                He became a close companion of the Messenger, peace be upon him. This companionship tempered his character such that when the time came and the First Caliph, Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, 
                was near to death and indicated that Umar should be the Caliph after him the other senior companions were able to accept. Their initial misgivings due to his sometimes harsh 
                character were also laid to rest in the early days of his reign as he encouraged criticism. Amongst the initial Caliphs his reign was the longest and most peaceful. The expansion 
                of the areas ruled by the Caliph was largely peaceful. A beautiful example is when he travelled to Jerusalem to accept the surrender of the city. On his arrival no one could 
                tell who was the Caliph as he was dressed the same as everyone else. And indeed had been taking turns with his assistant to ride upon their camel and it was actually the assistant's 
                turn on their approach to the city. Beside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre there is a famous mosque called the mosque of Umar. This is because when the Patriarch invited him 
                to pray within the Church he refused out of fear that Muslims of the future may wish to make the Church into a mosque.

            <h2>Media</h2>
            <p>There is in fact not much media featuring the second Caliph. Even 'The Message' a movie released in 1976 about the history of Islam did not feature any of the 
            foremost companions out of respect. Therefore the 30 episode 'Omar series' released by MBC was slightly controversial in that it did depict these great people.
